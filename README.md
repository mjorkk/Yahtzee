## Game Dynamics

The dynamics of the Yahtzee game are designed to capture the essence of the classic tabletop game. Players take turns rolling a set of five dice with the goal of achieving specific combinations to earn points. The strategic element comes into play when deciding which combinations to target and when to reroll the dice.

## Game Mechanics

### Dice Rolling
- Players roll five dice in each turn.
- After the initial roll, they can choose to reroll any number of dice up to two more times.
- The final combination after three rolls is used to score points.

## Scoring Combinations
- The game includes standard Yahtzee scoring combinations such as three of a kind, four of a kind, full house, small straight, large straight, and Yahtzee (five of a kind).
- Players can also score points in the upper section by accumulating the sum of a specific number (1 to 6) multiplied by the number of dice showing that number.

- Here are the scoring combinations available in the Yahtzee game:
